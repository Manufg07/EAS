# Hardhat Project with EAS Integration

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat setup with EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) integration. It is a work in progress, designed to explore the potential of EAS for identity attestation and schema management. The project includes smart contracts, deployment scripts, and testing utilities for hands-on experimentation.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
